download the `archive.zip` data file and extract it. When it has been extracted, open the folder, and inside `tobacco3482-jpg` folder there should be a duplicate folder with the same name. Make sure to delete the duplicate, and then move the original `tobacco3482-jpg` into the `in` folder of the `assignment3` directory.
When done, it should look something like this:

```

        ├── assignment2/
        └── assignment3/
